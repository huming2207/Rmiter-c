# RMIT2iCal
Previously called "Rmiter-c". Just an unofficial, pure C99 implementation of RMIT University's myRMIT timetable crawling tool, converting myRMIT timetable to iCalendar!

**This project is not maintained and/or affiliated with RMIT University and their staffs. Meanwhile this project contains reverse engineering works, as a result it should be only used as education and research purposes.**

## How to compile 
### 1. Installing toolchain, cmake, libcurl, etc.

If you are using Debian, Ubuntu or Deepin Linux, you may need to run this command to install.

```
apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev build-essential automake autoconf m4 cmake libtool
```

If you are using macOS, you may need to install these items by using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

```
brew install cmake automake autoconf libcurl m4
```

### 2. Installing gumbo-parser

[Gumbo-parser](https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser) is a great pure C HTML5 parser implementation made by Google. 

If you are using macOS, you can install it by using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```
